Steamtricks runs alongside Steam to automatically fix known issues with various
games on Linux.

- Check dependencies and prompt to install missing
- Apply fixes anytime a game is updated
- Display status notifications
- Suspend checks while games are running

For example the following will occurred after Multiwinia is installed.

If missing dependencies were found the user will be prompted to install them.
For example when the "Dota 2 - Vulkan support" DLC is installed Steamtricks will
automatically prompt the user to install the required Vulkan packages.

Fixes will also be applied after games are updated since local file changes are
reverted as part of the update process.

Alternatively, for games that work just fine or those for which fixes are not
available Steamtricks will let you know it checked.
